VIDEO STYLE: STORY-BASED NARRATIVE (NOT educational facts or lists)

{content_type_guidance}

{mystery_type_guidance}

CRITICAL STRUCTURE (3 Acts - NARRATIVE FLOW):

ACT 1 - THE HOOK (0-8 seconds, ~15 words max):
Formula: "[Specific date], [Location]. [Impossible event]. [Intriguing detail]."

Examples:
‚úÖ "December 5th, 1945, Fort Lauderdale. Five torpedo bombers vanished mid-flight. No wreckage was ever found."
‚úÖ "1587, Roanoke Island. An entire colony of 115 people disappeared overnight. Only one word remained: CROATOAN."
‚úÖ "October 21st, 1978. Frederick Valentich radioed: It's not an aircraft. Then vanished forever."

ACT 2 - THE MYSTERY (8-75 seconds, ~300 words):

SETUP (15 seconds, ~40 words):
- WHO: Introduce subject with specific names
- WHAT: The normal situation before the mystery
- WHERE: Specific location with details
- WHEN: Exact date and time if possible
- Establish this was routine/expected

Example: "Frederick Valentich was an experienced pilot. October 21st, 1978. Seven PM. He took off from Melbourne in a Cessna 182. Routine training flight. Clear skies. Perfect visibility. Twenty minutes into the flight, everything changed."

INCIDENT (25 seconds, ~70 words):
- What happened that's unexplainable
- Short sentences for impact
- Build tension with pacing
- Include direct quotes if available
- The moment things became impossible

Example: "Valentich radioed air traffic control. 'There's an aircraft above me.' Controllers saw nothing on radar. 'It's not an aircraft. It's‚Äî' Static. Controllers asked him to identify it. Valentich's final words: 'It's hovering. It's not an aircraft.' Then seventeen seconds of metallic scraping sounds. Silence."

CONTRADICTION (20 seconds, ~55 words):
- MUST start with: "But here's where it gets strange..." OR "The most terrifying part?" OR "What investigators found next..."
- Present evidence that contradicts normal explanations
- Stack impossibilities
- Facts that don't make sense together
- Create cognitive dissonance

Example: "But here's where it gets strange. The weather was perfect. No storms. No mechanical issues. The plane was well-maintained. Valentich had over 150 flight hours. Search teams scanned 1,000 square miles. For five years. Not a single piece of wreckage. No oil slicks. No debris. Nothing."

TWIST (15 seconds, ~40 words):
- Save the MOST chilling detail for last
- "The most terrifying part?" or "What investigators found next..."
- The detail that makes it truly unexplainable
- The thing that still haunts investigators

Example: "The most terrifying part? In 2014, a partial engine cowl washed ashore. Analysis confirmed: it was Valentich's plane. But the damage pattern didn't match a crash. Something had torn it apart. In mid-air."

ACT 3 - CLIFFHANGER (75-90 seconds, ~25 words):
- "To this day..." statement
- Unanswered question
- Prompt for viewer theories
- Create FOMO for engagement

Example: "To this day, no one knows what Frederick Valentich saw that night. The recording still exists. The Australian government can't explain it. What do YOU think he encountered?"

NARRATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ Write as FLOWING NARRATIVE STORY (like telling a story to a friend)
‚úÖ NO bullet points or lists in the script
‚úÖ Specific dates, names, numbers (not "a plane" but "five torpedo bombers")
‚úÖ Short sentences (8-15 words maximum per sentence)
‚úÖ Vary sentence length for rhythm and impact
‚úÖ Serious, mysterious tone (NOT excited, NOT cheerful)
‚úÖ Build contradictions naturally ("Perfect weather... yet they vanished")
‚úÖ Leave mystery UNSOLVED (don't provide definitive answer)
‚úÖ 350-450 words total (will be read at 0.85 speed = 60-90 seconds)
‚úÖ Proper punctuation for TTS pauses (periods = long pause, commas = short)
‚úÖ Use paragraph breaks (\\n\\n) for natural pauses between sections

AVOID:
‚ùå "Today I'll tell you about..." (too educational)
‚ùå "This is crazy!" or "Unbelievable!" (show don't tell)
‚ùå Lists/bullet points in narration
‚ùå Spoiling the mystery upfront
‚ùå "Have you heard of..." (weak hook)
‚ùå Explaining how weird it is (let facts speak)
‚ùå Unverified conspiracy theories
‚ùå Graphic violence descriptions
‚ùå Active missing persons cases (ethical concern)
‚ùå Special characters or quotes in JSON output (breaks parsing)

VISUAL STYLE FOR IMAGE PROMPTS:
Every visual prompt MUST include: "film noir photography, high contrast black and white, 
dramatic shadows, moody atmosphere, vintage 1940s-1960s aesthetic, film grain, mysterious, 
unsettling, documentary style, cinematic lighting, foggy, dark, noir aesthetic"

Two hours later, Taylor's voice crackled through the radio. 'We can't find west. Everything is wrong. Even the ocean doesn't look right.' Controllers tried to guide them back. Taylor's compass was malfunctioning. Both compasses. On all five planes. Simultaneously.

The Navy launched the largest search in history. Two hundred forty thousand square miles. Three hundred aircraft. Five days of continuous searching.

But here's where it gets strange. No wreckage. No oil slicks. No debris. No bodies. Not a single piece of metal. Five massive aircraft. Simply gone. As if they never existed.

The most terrifying part? A rescue plane was sent to find them. A Martin Mariner. Thirteen crew members. It also vanished. Same night. Same ocean. No distress call. No explanation.

Six aircraft. Twenty-seven men. Zero evidence. The Navy's official report concluded: 'as if they flew to Mars.'

They never came back.

A search team found their tent on February 26th. It had been ripped open from the inside. As if they were desperate to escape. Their boots were still inside. Their supplies untouched. But the hikers were gone.

The first bodies were found at the edge of the forest. Barefoot. In freezing temperatures. Dead from hypothermia. But that was just the beginning.

But here's where it gets strange. Three more bodies were found in a ravine. Severe internal injuries. Fractured skulls. Broken ribs. One woman was missing her tongue. Another's eyes were gone. The force required? Equivalent to a car crash. Yet no external wounds. No signs of a struggle.

The most terrifying part? Their clothes contained high levels of radiation. The tent had mysterious orange lights above it that night. Witnesses reported strange glowing orbs in the sky.

The Soviet investigation concluded: 'death by unknown compelling force.'

To this day, no one can explain what made nine experienced hikers flee their tent barefoot into deadly cold. What were they running from?""",

The carbon dating confirmed it. Created in the early 15th century. Over 600 years old. Written on vellum. Real medieval ink. This wasn't a modern hoax.

Cryptographers tried to decode it. World War Two codebreakers. The NSA. Computer algorithms. All failed. The text follows statistical patterns of real language. It has grammar. Structure. Syntax. But the words? Complete gibberish. Or a code so complex it's never been broken.

But here's where it gets strange. The plants in the illustrations don't match any known species. Some look like combinations of different plants. Impossible hybrids. The astronomical charts show constellations that don't exist. The biological drawings depict organs arranged in ways that make no anatomical sense.

The most terrifying part? Linguistic analysis suggests the text isn't random. It has too much structure. Too much consistency. Someone spent years writing this. Creating elaborate illustrations. For what purpose?

Carbon dating proves it's medieval. Statistical analysis proves the language is structured. But after 600 years and countless experts, no one can read a single word.

A massive naval cargo ship with 309 crew members. Vanished without sending an SOS. The largest loss of life in US Naval history not involving combat.

Weather can't explain it. The triangle has no more storms than anywhere else. Magnetic anomalies? The compass variations are normal. Methane gas eruptions? No evidence. Rogue waves? They don't erase radio signals.

But here's where it gets strange. The disappearances follow patterns. Ships and planes lose radio contact suddenly. No mayday calls. No emergency beacons. Just silence. When search teams arrive, they find nothing. No debris field. No oil slicks. The ocean is empty. As if the vessels simply ceased to exist.

The most terrifying part? It still happens. In 2015, the cargo ship El Faro disappeared in the triangle. 33 crew members. Modern navigation systems. Satellite communications. All lost. The wreckage was eventually found, but the black box recording ends abruptly. Mid-transmission. No explanation.
